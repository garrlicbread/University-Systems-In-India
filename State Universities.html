            <p style="text-align: center;">
                State universities are public universities run by the state government of each of the states and territories of India, and are usually established by a local legislative assembly act. 
                The University Grants Commission (UGC), draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination. 
                The UGC publishes and regularly updates the lists of state universities. As of 4 March 2021, the UGC lists 443 state universities. The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Calcutta, the University of Madras and the University of Mumbai.
