            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Evolution of Private Universities in India:</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Over the last two decades India has witnessed a rapid rise in the number of private universities. Various state governments have encouraged and justified this growth in order to increase enrolment in higher education, and private capital has welcomed this state encouragement. However, the implications of this move on access to higher education and the variety of other challenges that it presents are debated. Based on higher education enrolment data from the All India Survey on Higher Education, this paper attempts to study the social and academic character of universities to understand the consequences of the rapid growth of private universities for the university space as a whole.
                In ­India, private investment at the level of universities has either led to the establishment of institutions deemed to be universities (deemed universities, hereafter) approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC), Government of India, and private universities approved by different state governments. Between the second half of the 1990s—the period during which the ­initial private universities were established—and 2008, the number of deemed universities in India increased from 33 to 116 (UGC 2018). A majority of these new institutions were set up with private capital.
